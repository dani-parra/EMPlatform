# EMPlatform
A project built to manage in basic way a little company that sells some products, and applying languages, tools and frameworks like mysql, nodejs, spring, react-native, angular.

## Notes
  * This project was built mainly because i want to remember and practice some tools that i used before, and try to learn better ways to code, :bowtie: if you see a better way to implement some part of the code, i'm glad that you create an issue to help me to map that (error/wrong implementation) to add to the roadmap list :bowtie:
  
  * According with the note placed above, this project could be :facepunch: (with your help) :facepunch: a base to some students and professionals that are looking some code with the languages implemented here.
  
  * Currently i'm not using cloud services because in this moment i don't want to have a profit that help me to maintain a implementation using AWS or GCP, if i later want to use them i would like to deploy all in services like ec2, beanstalk, appengine, rds, s3, GCP storage, and build the infraestructure with terraform to have control in the cloud resources.

## Roadmap
The main implementations that are queued to be implemented in the project are:
 * KMS.
 * LDAP.
 * Request and Response Schema validators.
 * contain the services in docker images.
 * Orchestrate the containers with some tool like minikube, minishift or other tool like that (to define).
 * Open the platform to the clients.
 * Queue tool like rabbit or other (to define).
 * Push notifications with a provider like onesignal in free tier (to define).
 * Improve the security implemented to the services in the first version.
